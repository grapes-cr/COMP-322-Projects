# COMP-322-Projects
Projects for COMP 322 Operating Systems at CSUN. Coded in C.

These labs are fully interactive and can be run with any C compiler. Lab 1 utilizes structs and linked lists to simulate Process Control Blocks in an operating system. Lab 2 simulates process scheduling using algorithms FIFO, SRT, and SJF. Lab 3 uses the Banker's Algorithm to simulate resource allocation and deadlock avoidance. Lab 4 focuses on memory allocation, deallocation, and defragmentation using hole-fitting algorithms such as best-fit and first-fit. Lab 5 simulates disk scheduling using algorithms FIFO, SSTF, Scan, and C-Scan.
